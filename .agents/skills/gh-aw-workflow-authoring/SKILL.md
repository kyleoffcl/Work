# ✍️ GitHub Agentic Workflows - Workflow Authoring Skill

## 📋 Purpose

Master the art of authoring **GitHub Agentic Workflows** - creating AI-powered automation using natural language markdown instead of complex YAML. This skill provides comprehensive expertise in workflow design, natural language instructions, configuration, and best practices for effective agentic automation.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### What Makes Agentic Workflows Different?

**Traditional GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
# Complex conditional logic
if: |
  contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'bug') &&
  !contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'wontfix') &&
  github.event.issue.state == 'open'
run: echo "Process bug"
```

**Agentic Workflow:**
```markdown
If this is an open bug that should be fixed, provide helpful triage information.
```

**Key Differences:**

| Traditional Actions | Agentic Workflows |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ✅ Deterministic | 🤖 AI-driven decisions |
| ⚙️ Complex YAML | 📝 Natural language |
| 🔧 Fixed logic paths | 🧠 Context-aware responses |
| 📊 Explicit conditionals | 💡 Inferred intent |

## 🏗️ Workflow Structure

## 📝 Natural Language Instructions

### Writing Effective Prompts

**1. Be Specific and Clear:**

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
Do something with this issue.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Analyze this issue and:
1. Determine if it's a bug, feature request, or question
2. Check for duplicates in existing issues
3. Suggest appropriate labels
4. Add a helpful comment with next steps
```

**2. Provide Context:**

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
Fix the code.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Review the changed files in this PR and:
- Check for common security issues (SQL injection, XSS)
- Verify error handling is comprehensive
- Ensure tests cover new functionality
- Suggest improvements following our style guide
```

**3. Structure with Lists:**

```markdown
Perform code review with focus on:

**Security:**
- Input validation
- Authentication checks
- Data sanitization

**Quality:**
- Code duplication
- Function complexity
- Test coverage

**Documentation:**
- API documentation
- Inline comments
- README updates
```

**4. Use Examples:**

```markdown
Analyze this pull request and provide feedback similar to:

"## Code Review

### Security Concerns
- Line 45: User input not validated

### Performance
- Line 78: Consider caching this result

### Style
- Follows project conventions ✓"
```

### Prompt Engineering Patterns

**Pattern 1: Analyze → Decide → Act**
```markdown
1. Analyze the issue description and comments
2. Decide if it's a duplicate or new issue
3. If duplicate: Close with reference to original
4. If new: Add labels and assign to appropriate team
```

**Pattern 2: Conditional Instructions**
```markdown
If this is a security issue:
- Add 'security' label
- Mark as high priority
- Notify security team

If this is a feature request:
- Add 'enhancement' label
- Ask for use case details
- Add to product backlog
```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Step Workflow**
```markdown
Step 1: Review all changed files
Step 2: Identify potential issues
Step 3: For each issue found:
  - Note the file and line number
  - Explain the problem
  - Suggest a solution
Step 4: Summarize findings in a comment
```

- Check if major version bump
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Check for deprecated features used

## License Check
- Verify license compatibility
- Flag any license changes
- Note GPL or other copyleft licenses

## Recommendation
Provide:
- ✅ Safe to merge
- ⚠️ Review required
- ❌ Security concerns

Include:
- Specific issues found
- Recommended actions

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
---
on: issues

concurrency:
  group: issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
---
```

**Use Cases:**
- Prevent duplicate processing
- Cancel outdated runs
- Resource management

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
---
on: pull_request

if: |
  github.event.pull_request.draft == false &&
  !contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-review')
---
```

### Timeouts

```yaml
---
timeout-minutes: 5  # Cancel if exceeds 5 minutes
---
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
---
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '20'
  DEBUG: 'true'
---
```

## 🔄 Compilation Process

### Manual Compilation

```bash
# Install compiler
npm install -g @github/agentic-workflows-compiler

# Compile workflow
aw-compile .github/workflows/issue-triage.md

# Output: .github/workflows/issue-triage.lock.yml
```

### Automatic Compilation

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
name: Compile Agentic Workflows

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/*.md'

jobs:
  compile:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Compile Workflows
        run: |
          npm install -g @github/agentic-workflows-compiler
          aw-compile .github/workflows/*.md
      
      - name: Commit Compiled Files
        run: |
          git add .github/workflows/*.lock.yml
          git commit -m "Compile agentic workflows"
          git push
```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate syntax
aw-validate .github/workflows/issue-triage.md

# Check for common issues
aw-lint .github/workflows/issue-triage.md
```

## 🎨 Best Practices

### 1. Single Responsibility

❌ **Bad: Multiple tasks in one workflow**
```markdown
Triage issues, review PRs, update documentation, and manage dependencies.
```

✅ **Good: Focused workflow**
```markdown
Triage new issues by analyzing content, checking for duplicates, and applying appropriate labels.
```

### 2. Clear Success Criteria

❌ **Bad: Vague instructions**
```markdown
Make this better.
```

✅ **Good: Specific criteria**
```markdown
Improve this code by:
- Reducing cyclomatic complexity to <10
- Adding error handling for edge cases
- Including unit tests with 80%+ coverage
```

### 3. Tool Minimalism

❌ **Bad: Grant all tools**
```yaml
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: ['*']
  bash:
  safeoutputs___*:
```

✅ **Good: Only required tools**
```yaml
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
  safeoutputs___comment:
```

### 4. Error Guidance

```markdown
If you encounter issues:
1. Check for existing similar issues first
2. If API rate limit reached, note it and suggest trying later
3. If insufficient permissions, explain what's needed
4. Always provide fallback recommendations
```

### 5. Testing Instructions

```markdown
Before implementation:
1. Validate file paths exist
2. Check for required permissions
3. Verify tool availability
4. Test with dry-run if possible

Use safeoutputs___noop to report findings if validation fails.
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Overly Complex Instructions

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Analyze code considering 27 different quality metrics, cross-reference with 15 different documentation sources, generate detailed reports with statistical analysis, create visualization dashboards, and...
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Focus on 3 key areas:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Test coverage
3. Code complexity

Provide actionable feedback for each.
```

### Pitfall 2: Assuming Tool Availability

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Use bash to run npm install...
```

✅ **Do:**
```yaml
---
tools:
  bash:
    allowed-commands: [npm]
---

If npm is available, run npm install to verify dependencies.
```

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Rate Limits

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Search all 10,000 issues for duplicates.
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Search recent issues (last 90 days) for duplicates.
If none found, note that older issues weren't checked due to performance.
```

### Pitfall 4: Not Handling Failures

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Update the file with new content.
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Attempt to update the file.
If it fails (permissions, file doesn't exist, etc.):
- Use safeoutputs___noop to explain the issue
- Suggest manual resolution steps
```
