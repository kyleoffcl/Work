# Nova Act Usability Testing v2.0.0

**AI-orchestrated** usability testing with digital twin personas powered by Amazon Nova Act.

## What's New in 2.0.0

**Agent-Driven Interpretation**: The script no longer interprets responses. YOU (the agent) must:
1. Run the test script → collect raw data
2. Read JSON → interpret each `raw_response` 
3. Set `goal_achieved` and `overall_success`
4. Generate the report

No hardcoded regex. No extra API calls. The agent doing the work is already running.

## Quick Start (For AI Agents)

**When a user asks to test a website, YOU (the AI agent) must complete ALL 4 phases:**

| Phase | What Happens | Who Does It |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 1. Setup | Generate personas, run test script | Agent + Script |
| 2. Collect | Script captures raw Nova Act responses | Script |
| 3. Interpret | Read JSON, determine goal_achieved for each step | **Agent** |
| 4. Report | Generate HTML report with interpreted results | Agent |

**⚠️ The script does NOT interpret responses or generate the final report. You must do phases 3-4.**

### 🎯 Recommended: AI Agent Generates Personas

**You're already an AI (Claude) - use your intelligence to generate contextual personas!**

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys
import json
import tempfile

# Step 1: Check dependencies
try:
    import nova_act
    print("✅ Dependencies ready")
except ImportError:
    print("📦 Installing dependencies (one-time setup, ~3 minutes)...")
    skill_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability")
    result = subprocess.run(["./setup.sh"], cwd=skill_dir, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f"❌ Setup failed. Run manually: cd {skill_dir} && ./setup.sh")
        sys.exit(1)

# Step 2: Verify Nova Act API key
config_file = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/config/nova-act.json")
with open(config_file, 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
    if config.get('apiKey') == 'your-nova-act-api-key-here':
        print(f"⚠️  Please add your Nova Act API key to {config_file}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Step 3: YOU (the AI agent) generate personas
# Example for https://www.pgatour.com/ (golf tournament site)
website_url = "https://www.pgatour.com/"

personas = [
    {
        "name": "Marcus Chen",
        "archetype": "tournament_follower",
        "age": 42,
        "tech_proficiency": "high",
        "description": "Avid golf fan who follows multiple tours and tracks player stats",
        "goals": [
            "Check current tournament leaderboard",
            "View recent tournament results",
            "Track favorite player performance"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Dorothy Williams",
        "archetype": "casual_viewer",
        "age": 68,
        "tech_proficiency": "low",
        "description": "Occasional golf viewer who watches major tournaments",
        "goals": [
            "Find when the next tournament is",
            "See who won recently",
            "Understand how to watch online"
        ]
    }
]

# Step 4: Save personas and run test
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.json', delete=False) as f:
    json.dump(personas, f, indent=2)
    personas_file = f.name

skill_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability")
test_script = os.path.join(skill_dir, "scripts", "run_adaptive_test.py")

# Run with AI-generated personas
subprocess.run([sys.executable, test_script, website_url, personas_file])

# Clean up temp file
os.unlink(personas_file)
```

**Persona Template:**
```json
{
  "name": "FirstName LastName",
  "archetype": "descriptive_identifier",
  "age": 30,
  "tech_proficiency": "low|medium|high",
  "description": "One sentence about who they are",
  "goals": [
    "First goal relevant to this website",
    "Second goal relevant to this website",
    "Third goal relevant to this website"
  ]
}
```

### 📝 Alternative: Simple Custom Persona

If user specifies a persona description, pass it as a string:

```python
# User: "Test PGA Tour site as a golf enthusiast"
website_url = "https://www.pgatour.com/"
user_persona = "golf enthusiast who follows tournaments closely"

subprocess.run([sys.executable, test_script, website_url, user_persona])
# Script will parse this and create personas automatically
```

### ⚠️ Fallback: Auto-Generation (Not Recommended)

Let the script guess personas based on basic category keywords:

```python
# Generic, less contextual personas
subprocess.run([sys.executable, test_script, website_url])
```

### Why YOU Should Generate Personas

**✅ Advantages:**
- **Better context:** You have full conversation history and domain knowledge
- **Smarter inference:** You can analyze the URL, industry, and user intent
- **No duplicate API calls:** You're already Claude - don't call yourself again!
- **User preferences:** You can adapt based on stated preferences
- **Clarifying questions:** You can ask the user about target demographics

**❌ What to avoid:**
- Don't let Python script make its own Claude API call (wasteful)
- Don't rely on generic fallback personas (less accurate)
- Don't skip persona generation (hurts test quality)

### 💡 Tips for Persona Generation

**Analyze the website:**
- **URL domain:** `.gov` → citizens, `.edu` → students/faculty
- **Keywords:** "shop" → shoppers, "book" → travelers, "play" → gamers
- **Industry:** Golf → fans/players, Banking → customers/businesses

**Create diverse personas:**
- Mix experience levels (beginner, intermediate, expert)
- Mix tech proficiency (low, medium, high)  
- Mix age ranges (young, middle-aged, senior)
- Mix motivations (casual, professional, enthusiastic)

**Generate realistic goals:**
- Specific to the website's purpose
- Actionable and measurable
- Match the persona's characteristics

**Examples by industry:**
- **E-commerce:** bargain_hunter, comparison_shopper, impulse_buyer
- **News:** daily_reader, topic_follower, casual_browser
- **Sports:** die_hard_fan, casual_viewer, stats_tracker
- **Travel:** business_traveler, vacation_planner, deal_seeker
- **SaaS:** power_user, evaluator, beginner
## User Invocation

Users can trigger this skill by saying:
- "Test the usability of [website URL]"
- "Run a usability test on [website URL]"
- "Generate a usability report for [website URL]"
- "Evaluate the UX of [website URL]"
- "Analyze [website URL] for usability issues"
- **NEW:** "Test the booking flow on [website]"
- **NEW:** "Test the checkout process on [e-commerce site]"
- **NEW:** "Test posting workflow on [social media site]"

**The AI will automatically:**
1. Load the Nova Act cookbook for guidance
2. Analyze the page to understand it
3. Detect if it's a workflow-based site (booking, e-commerce, social, etc.)
4. **Generate contextual personas:**
   - If custom persona specified → Create persona matching that description
   - If no custom persona → Use Claude AI to infer the 3 most plausible real-world user types
   - Fallback to category-based personas if AI unavailable
5. Create realistic test cases (including full workflows when appropriate)
6. Run adaptive, iterative tests with Nova Act
7. **NEW:** Apply safety stops before material impact actions (payment, posting, account creation)
8. Generate comprehensive HTML report with trace links
9. Provide viewing instructions

## Workflow Testing

**NEW in this version:** The skill now tests complete user journeys, not just information-finding!

### Supported Workflows

**E-Commerce:**
- Product search → Add to cart → Checkout → **STOP before payment**

**Flight/Hotel Booking:**
- Search → Select → Fill details → **STOP before booking**

**Social Media:**
- Create post → Add content → **STOP before publishing**

**Account Signup:**
- Fill registration → **STOP before final submission**

**Form Submission:**
- Fill form → **STOP before submit**

### Safety Guardrails

This skill includes guardrails designed to stop before material impact actions. However, **no AI-based system can guarantee safety**—behavior depends on website structure, Nova Act responses, and real-time conditions.

**Guardrails are designed to:**
- Stop before completing purchases
- Stop before creating accounts
- Stop before posting publicly
- Stop before sending emails/messages
- Stop before subscribing to newsletters
- Stop before actions with monetary/legal/reputational impact

**The skill is designed to:**
- Test up to (but not including) the final action
- Verify the final button exists and is accessible
- Document the safety stop in observations

**⚠️ Recommendation:** Always test on staging environments first. Do not run against production systems with real payment methods or accounts without understanding the risks.

## 🧠 Agent Analysis (CRITICAL)

**You (the AI agent) must analyze test results!** The script collects raw responses but does NOT interpret them.

### Why Agent Analysis?

The script returns raw Nova Act responses like:
- `"No"` - Is there a pricing link?
- `"I don't see any documentation"` - Is there docs?
- `"Amazon Nova Act"` - What is the headline?

**You must determine if each response means the goal was achieved:**

| Response | Goal Achieved? |
|----------|---------------|
| `"No"` | ❌ NOT achieved |
| `"I don't see..."` | ❌ NOT achieved |
| `"Not found"` | ❌ NOT achieved |
| `"Yes, I found..."` | ✅ Achieved |
| `"Amazon Nova Act"` (content) | ✅ Achieved |
| `"The pricing is $29/mo"` | ✅ Achieved |

### Result Data Structure

After the test script runs, read the JSON results. Each step contains:

```json
{
    "step_name": "check_nav_for_pricing",
    "prompt": "Is there a pricing link in the navigation?",
    "expected_outcome": "Find pricing in navigation",
    "raw_response": "No",
    "api_success": true,
    "needs_agent_analysis": true,
    "attempts": [
        {
            "prompt": "Is there a pricing link in the navigation?",
            "response": "No",
            "approach": "original"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key fields you analyze:**
- `raw_response`: The actual Nova Act response - YOU determine what it means
- `api_success`: Did the API call work? (script handles this)
- `needs_agent_analysis`: Always `true` - your cue to interpret
- `attempts`: All attempts made (script tries up to 3 alternative approaches)

### How to Analyze

**For each step, determine:**
1. `goal_achieved`: Did the response indicate success or failure?
2. `friction_level`: How hard was it? (attempts.length > 1 = friction)
3. `observations`: UX insights from the response

**Analysis example:**

```
Step 1: "Is there a pricing link?" 
  → Response: "No" (1 attempt)
  → Goal achieved: NO (explicit negative)
  → Friction: HIGH (not discoverable)

Step 2: "What is the headline?" 
  → Response: "Amazon Nova Act" (1 attempt)
  → Goal achieved: YES (actual content)
  → Friction: LOW (immediately visible)

Step 3: "Find documentation" 
  → Response: "I found a docs link in the footer" (3 attempts)
  → Goal achieved: YES (found eventually)
  → Friction: MEDIUM (required multiple approaches)
```

### Helper Functions (For Script Integration)

The `response_interpreter.py` provides helpers if you want structured prompts:

```python
from scripts.response_interpreter import (
    format_for_agent_analysis,
    create_agent_prompt_for_interpretation,
    create_agent_prompt_for_alternative
)

# Format all results for analysis
formatted = format_for_agent_analysis(results)

# Get interpretation prompt for one step
prompt = create_agent_prompt_for_interpretation(step_result)

# Get retry prompt when goal not achieved  
retry_prompt = create_agent_prompt_for_alternative(
    original_prompt="Is there a pricing link?",
    failed_response="No",
    attempt_number=2
)
```

### Complete Analysis Workflow (MANDATORY)

**The script does NOT generate the final report automatically.** You (the agent) must:

1. **Run the test script** → outputs `test_results_adaptive.json` with raw data
2. **Read the JSON** into your context
3. **Interpret each step** → set `goal_achieved: true/false` based on `raw_response`
4. **Set overall success** → set `overall_success: true/false` on each test
5. **Save updated JSON**
6. **Call report generator** with interpreted results

**Step-by-step code for the agent to execute:**

```python
import json
import os
import sys

# Add skill scripts to path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability/scripts"))
from enhanced_report_generator import generate_enhanced_report

# 1. Read raw results
with open('test_results_adaptive.json', 'r') as f:
    results = json.load(f)

# 2. YOU (the agent) interpret each step
for test in results:
    goals_achieved = 0
    for step in test.get('steps', []):
        raw = step.get('raw_response', '')
        
        # AGENT INTERPRETS: Does this response indicate goal was achieved?
        # You decide based on the response content and expected outcome
        # Example interpretations:
        #   "No" → goal_achieved = False
        #   "Leaderboard, News, Schedule, Players" → goal_achieved = True (content found)
        #   "Yes" → goal_achieved = True
        #   "I don't see any..." → goal_achieved = False
        
        step['goal_achieved'] = ???  # YOU set this based on your interpretation
        if step['goal_achieved']:
            goals_achieved += 1
    
    # 3. Set overall success (e.g., >= 50% goals achieved)
    total = len(test.get('steps', []))
    test['goals_achieved'] = goals_achieved
    test['overall_success'] = (goals_achieved / total >= 0.5) if total > 0 else False

# 4. Save interpreted results
with open('test_results_adaptive.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)

# 5. Generate report with interpreted data
page_analysis = {
    'title': '...',  # From your earlier analysis
    'purpose': '...',
    'navigation': [...]
}
all_traces = []
for r in results:
    all_traces.extend(r.get('trace_files', []))

report_path = generate_enhanced_report(page_analysis, results, all_traces)
print(f"Report: {report_path}")
```

**Why the agent must interpret:**
- No hardcoded regex or pattern matching
- You understand context (what "Yes" means for this specific question)
- You can reason about partial success, edge cases
- No duplicate Claude API calls - you're already running!

## ⚠️ Critical: Keep Nova Act Prompts Simple

**Nova Act is a browser automation tool, NOT a reasoning engine.**

The Claude agent (you) does all reasoning about:
- What to test based on the persona
- Whether results are good or bad
- What the UX implications are

Nova Act just:
- Clicks, types, scrolls
- Reports what it sees

### ❌ WRONG: Asking Nova Act to reason

```python
# DON'T ask Nova Act to think about personas
nova.act("As a beginner user, can you easily find the documentation?")
nova.act("Would a business professional find the pricing clear?")
nova.act("Is this task accomplishable for someone with low technical skills?")
```

### ✅ RIGHT: Simple, direct browser commands

```python
# Simple browser actions
nova.act("Click the Documentation link in the navigation")
nova.act("Find and click a link containing 'Pricing'")
nova.act_get("What text is displayed in the main heading?")
nova.act_get("List the navigation menu items visible on this page")
```

### The Correct Workflow

1. **Agent** (you) decides what to test based on persona: "Dorothy is 68 with low tech skills - she wants to know how to watch golf online"
2. **Agent** generates simple Nova Act prompts: "Click 'Watch & Listen' in the navigation"
3. **Nova Act** executes browser task and returns raw results: "Clicked Watch & Listen, now on video page"
4. **Agent** interprets results: "Dorothy would find this confusing because the options are unclear..."

## How This Works

**You (the AI) are the orchestrator.** This skill provides:
1. **Nova Act cookbook** (`references/nova-act-cookbook.md`) - Best practices, workflow patterns, and safety guidelines (automatically loaded at test start)
2. **Adaptive test orchestrator** (`run_adaptive_test.py`) - Main execution script with workflow detection
3. **Dynamic strategy generator** (`scripts/dynamic_exploration.py`) - Generates workflow-appropriate test strategies
4. **Session management** (`scripts/nova_session.py`) - Nova Act wrapper
5. **Report generator** (`enhanced_report_generator.py`) - Auto-generated HTML reports

**Execution Flow:**

### CRITICAL: Check Dependencies First

**Before running ANY test, check if dependencies are installed:**

```bash
# Check if nova-act is installed
python3 -c "import nova_act" 2>/dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Dependencies not installed. Running setup..."
    cd ~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability
    ./setup.sh
    
    # After setup, remind user to add API key if needed
    if ! grep -q '"apiKey":.*[^"]' ~/.openclaw/config/nova-act.json; then
        echo "⚠️  Please add your Nova Act API key to ~/.openclaw/config/nova-act.json"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

**Or use Python to check:**

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

# Check if nova-act is installed
try:
    import nova_act
    print("✅ Dependencies already installed")
except ImportError:
    print("📦 Installing dependencies...")
    skill_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability")
    setup_script = os.path.join(skill_dir, "setup.sh")
    
    if os.path.exists(setup_script):
        result = subprocess.run([setup_script], cwd=skill_dir)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            print("❌ Setup failed. Please run manually:")
            print(f"   cd {skill_dir}")
            print(f"   ./setup.sh")
            sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("❌ Setup script not found. Dependencies must be installed manually.")
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Running Tests (After Dependencies Confirmed)

When a user asks for usability testing:

```bash
# Find the skill directory
SKILL_DIR=~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability

# Run the adaptive test script
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run_adaptive_test.py" "https://example.com"

# This will:
# - Create nova_act_logs/ in current directory
# - Create test_results_adaptive.json in current directory
# - Create nova_act_usability_report.html in current directory
# - Provide 60-second status updates during test
```

### ⏱️ Timeout Guidance

**Recommended timeout: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)**

Full usability tests with 3 personas × 3 goals = 9 tests can take 10-20+ minutes depending on:
- Website load times (slow sites like media-heavy sports sites take longer)
- Nova Act API response times (each act() call takes 5-60 seconds)
- Network conditions

**Graceful shutdown:** If the test is interrupted (timeout, SIGTERM, SIGINT), it will:
1. Save all completed test results to `test_results_adaptive.json`
2. Generate a **partial report** clearly marked as incomplete
3. Show how many tests completed vs planned

**For shorter tests:** Use fewer personas or goals:
```python
# Quick test with 1 persona
personas = [{"name": "Test User", "archetype": "casual", ...}]
```

### What You (the AI) Need to Do:

1. **Check dependencies** (run the check above)
2. **If missing**: Run setup.sh and inform user about API key
3. **If present**: Extract the website URL from user's request
4. **Run the test** with the URL as argument
5. **Monitor progress** (status updates every 60 seconds)
6. **Share the report** viewing instructions with user

## Quick Start

**When user requests usability testing:**

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Get skill directory
skill_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability")
if not os.path.exists(skill_dir):
    # Try workspace location
    skill_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "nova-act-usability")

script_path = os.path.join(skill_dir, "scripts", "run_adaptive_test.py")

# Run test
result = subprocess.run(
    ["python3", script_path, "https://example.com"],
    env={**os.environ, "NOVA_ACT_SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL": "1"},
    capture_output=True,
    text=True
)

print(result.stdout)
```

## Detailed Workflow (Internal)

The adaptive test script (`run_adaptive_test.py`) handles:

### Step 1: Page Analysis
- Loads the page with Nova Act
- Extracts title, navigation, purpose
- Identifies key elements (docs, demo, pricing)

### Step 2: Contextual Persona Generation
- Creates personas based on what the page offers
- Developer persona if API/code focused
- Business persona for evaluation
- Beginner persona if demo available

### Step 3: Realistic Test Case Generation
- Top 3 use cases per persona
- Based on actual page content
- Matched to persona goals

### Step 4: Iterative Test Execution

For each persona + task combination:

```python
from scripts.nova_session import nova_session
from nova_act import BOOL_SCHEMA
import time

observations = []

with nova_session(website_url) as nova:
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Initial navigation
    observations.append({
        "step": "navigate",
        "action": f"Loaded {website_url}",
        "success": True,
        "notes": "Initial page load"
    })
    
    # Execute task step-by-step (AI-orchestrated)
    # Break into small act() calls based on cookbook guidance
    
    # Example: "Find pricing information" task
    
    # Step 1: Look for pricing link
    nova.act("Look for a link or button for pricing, plans, or subscription")
    found = nova.act_get(
        "Is there a visible pricing or plans link?",
        schema=BOOL_SCHEMA
    )
    
    observations.append({
        "step": "find_pricing_link",
        "action": "Search for pricing navigation",
        "success": found.parsed_response,
        "notes": "Easy to find" if found.parsed_response else "Not immediately visible - UX friction"
    })
    
    if found.parsed_response:
        # Step 2: Navigate to pricing
        nova.act("Click on the pricing or plans link")
        
        # Step 3: Analyze pricing page
        is_clear = nova.act_get(
            "Is the pricing information clearly displayed with prices and features?",
            schema=BOOL_SCHEMA
        )
        
        observations.append({
            "step": "view_pricing",
            "action": "Accessed pricing page",
            "success": is_clear.parsed_response,
            "notes": "Clear pricing display" if is_clear.parsed_response else "Pricing unclear or confusing"
        })
    else:
        # Alternative path - try search
        nova.act("Look for a search function")
        # ... continue orchestrating
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Document overall task result
    task_success = all(obs["success"] for obs in observations if obs["success"] is not None)
    
    results.append({
        "persona": persona_name,
        "task": task_description,
        "success": task_success,
        "duration": duration,
        "observations": observations,
        "friction_points": [obs for obs in observations if not obs.get("success")]
    })
```

### Step 5: Pool and Analyze Results

After all tests:
1. Identify common friction points across personas
2. Note accessibility issues for low-tech personas
3. Flag efficiency problems (too many steps)
4. Document task failures (major UX issues)

### Step 6: Generate Report

```python
import json
from scripts.enhanced_report_generator import generate_enhanced_report

# Save results
with open("test_results_adaptive.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)

# Generate HTML report
report_path = generate_enhanced_report(
    page_analysis=page_analysis,
    results=test_results
)

print(f"Report: {report_path}")
```

## Key Principles

### Dynamic Task Decomposition

The AI should decide how to break down each task based on:
- Website complexity
- Persona's technical level
- Task nature (navigation vs data entry vs search)

**Low-tech persona example:**
```python
# More explicit, step-by-step
nova.act("Look for a button labeled 'Contact' or 'Contact Us'")
nova.act("Click on the Contact button")
result = nova.act_get("Is there a phone number or email address visible?")
```

**High-tech persona example:**
```python
# Test efficiency features
nova.act("Look for keyboard shortcuts or quick access features")
nova.act("Try to use search (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K)")
```

### Real-Time Observation

After EVERY `act()` call, analyze:
- Did it succeed?
- Was the UI element easy to find?
- Was the label clear?
- How many attempts needed?
- Any error messages?

Document friction immediately in observations.

### Persona-Aware Prompting

Adapt `act()` prompts to persona characteristics:
- **Elderly/low-tech:** Look for obvious, labeled buttons; read everything
- **Power users:** Try keyboard shortcuts, advanced features
- **Mobile users:** Test mobile responsiveness, touch targets
- **Screen reader users:** Test keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: First-Time Setup Required

**This skill requires dependencies that must be installed before use.**

### For AI Agents: Automatic Dependency Check

**ALWAYS check if dependencies are installed before running tests:**

```python
# Quick dependency check
try:
    import nova_act
    # Dependencies installed ✅
except ImportError:
    # Need to run setup ⚠️
    import subprocess
    import os
    
    skill_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability")
    setup_script = os.path.join(skill_dir, "setup.sh")
    
    print("📦 Installing Nova Act dependencies (one-time setup)...")
    print("This will take 2-3 minutes to download browsers (~300MB)")
    
    subprocess.run([setup_script], cwd=skill_dir, check=True)
    
    print("✅ Setup complete!")
    print("⚠️  User needs to add API key to ~/.openclaw/config/nova-act.json")
```

### For Users: One-Time Setup

If this is your first time using the skill:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/nova-act-usability
./setup.sh
```

**The setup script will:**
- ✅ Install Python dependencies (nova-act, pydantic, playwright)
- ✅ Download Playwright browsers (~300MB, 2-3 minutes)
- ✅ Create config file template

**After setup:**
1. Get your Nova Act API key from [Nova Act Developer Portal](https://nova.amazon.com/dev/api)
2. Edit `~/.openclaw/config/nova-act.json`
3. Replace `"your-nova-act-api-key-here"` with your actual key

### Manual Setup (If Automatic Fails)

```bash
pip3 install nova-act pydantic playwright
playwright install chromium
```

## Example: AI-Orchestrated Test

**User request:** "Test example.com for elderly users"

**AI orchestration:**

1. Read `references/nova-act-cookbook.md`
2. Read `references/persona-examples.md`
3. Generate elderly persona (Dorothy, 72, low tech proficiency)
4. Generate tasks:
   - "Find contact information"
   - "Read about services"
   - "Navigate to FAQ"
5. For each task, dynamically orchestrate Nova Act:
   - Start session
   - Execute small act() steps
   - Observe and analyze each result
   - Take notes on friction (small text, unclear labels, etc.)
   - Continue or adapt based on observations
6. Pool observations
7. Generate HTML report with findings and recommendations

**The AI decides every step.** The skill just provides tools and guidance.

## Output Files (Created in Working Directory)

When you run a test, these files are created in your current working directory:

```
./
├── nova_act_logs/                    # Nova Act trace files
│   ├── act_<id>_output.html         # Session recordings
│   └── ...
├── test_results_adaptive.json        # Raw test results
└── nova_act_usability_report.html   # Final report
```

All paths are relative - works from any installation location!
